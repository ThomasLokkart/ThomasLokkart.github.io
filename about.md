# About

This is where you put the contents of your *About* page. Like all your pages, it's in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.

My name is Thomas Lokkart. I am a chemist by training, but a programmer by heart. During my studies I developed n an interest in programming and ever since I started working in the field of software engineering, I feel at home. 

I started this blog, because I want to experience what it is like to share my thoughts with a (possible) public. I also hope to find out that, by writing, am able to develop my thoughts and keep track of what my main interests are. 

I am mainly interested in software engineering, and data science, anything technology related, really. I also have a profound interest in synthetic biology/protein design, stemming from my background in chemistry. Sustainability and circularity is another interest that I greatly cherish. 

In the unlikely event that anyone will ever find this blog, I hope you can learn a thing or two. This is the only thing I can hope for, after learning so much from other bloggers and people sharing their path on various media.
