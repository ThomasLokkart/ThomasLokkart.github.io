# It is easy to regret 

I remember the time I had to choose a study programme. Egitheen year old Thomas had to choose a study programme based on, in hindsight, almost zero information. Although, I was very enthousiastic about going to college, I was still very comfortable in my house with my parents, brothers and friends close by. I had no intention of going off too far. 

That left three universities: Technical University Eindhoven, Radboud University Nijmegen and Maastricht university. I always knew I wanted to do a _bÃ¨ta study programme_ and therefore Maastricht was quickly rejected. And, I am not going to lie, my first thought was, I had the best grade for chemistry in high school, and was therefore aiming to do something with chemistry at either Eindhoven or Nijmegen. I felt chemical engineering was not for me, therefore I chose chemistry at the Radboud University. Also, because I heard student life was good there. 

In hindsight, I regret that choice. In hindsight, I wish I felt a bigger urgency to check all study programmes (throughout the country). I wish I tried more stuff that is not necessarily taught at high school, but is molded into a college degree, like electrical engineering. 

After six and a half years of study I am now a software engineer. Looking back at this period, it was an interesting journey. Right now, I am still shaping my (main) interests.

I started chemistry, because I wanted to be like Walter White (yes, from _Breaking Bad_) but found out as soon as I did my lab internship that being in the lab was not for me. I did not like the repetition, the slowness, the constant pressure of making a tiny mistake with enormous consequences for your end result, and it is not even entirely your fault. Someone might have just accidentally knocked over your super unstable intermediaate product. No, I wanted something else. 

While I still liked the chemsitry, I felt my broader interest in statistics, physics and biology was not met at organic chemistry. Luckily, a group member from my lab internship did something with modelling and programming. That seemed cool, no unexplainable variables influencing your product and immediate feedback loops from your experiment. That was what I needed. 

I started my internship with him a few months after I did my lab internship and learned a bunch of things on modelling, parameter tuning and programming. Especially, the programming was a huge match. The constant euphoria when you solve only the smallest problem was exactly what I needed. Although, the intership was not so great in term of the product I delivered, I felt relieved, because I knew I wanted to do something with programming and possibly chemistry. But no labwork for me anymore. 

That led me to my last internship at a different group who was more concerned with modelling organism metabolisms. In my case, an arabidopsis thaliana metabolism. Do not bother looking it up, but it is a funny little plant. This sparked my interest in complex systems and also still programming, which I tried to incorporate in every wat at this internship.

I though long and hard about doing a PhD, but felt I was not ready for it. I did not really deliver on any results that were tangible and felt not confident in my abilities as a scientist. Though I (still) feel genuinge curiosity. I left for a consultancy job at a company giving advice on energy saving possibilities in industry. 

The sustainability part was awesome and something I truly was grateful for. However, I felt it did not spark that ultimate curiosity. I did not genuinely care whether people did something with my advice and that was a big bottleneck for me. I left for a software engineering job at another consultancy company, but here I feel happy. 

I guess, what I want to say is that there will always be things that you regret, as there are so many choices available. I am still trying to figure out how to deal with this. Though, I want to stress I am in no way unhappy! I am very grateful and happy with the opportunities I got, but it is easy to say in hindsight you would study something else.
