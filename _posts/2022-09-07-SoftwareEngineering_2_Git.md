# The greatest software engineering tool - Git 

Software engineering is a difficult topic that requires several different skills to be learned before one can call himself a master of the arts. The most memorizable thing I learned when I was learning to become a software engineer was that someone told me: "software engineering is not so much of a science, as it is a craft". This seems very obious, and it is. I, however, learned the hard way. 

Software engineering is a field that requires practicing over and over again. Just like any other craft, like learning how to draw. Many people will eventually be able to do it, some have more talent than others, but it requires a lot of practice. 

This is where Git comes in. In order to learn something fast, the best way is... to fail. Destroy things, disrupt control flows, get feedback that an action you performed does not work. I was sturdy and thought: "I know C++ syntax, I can just read the code and understand". I was very wrong. 

Git allows you to do exactly this. Download a repository, break things apart and learn what it does. Ofcourse, iin my case when doing C++, have cppreference.com at hand, but I can not stress enough how important it is to, as Nike has so bluntly stated on their slogan: "Just do it". Git allows you to reset and ***do*** things again. 

You do not have to learn command line Git, simpy use a GUI (like Fork, which I highly recommend) and start working that code. I even dare to say, on my software engineering journey, learning Git has been the most valuable skill I acquired (and I am far from an expert!). All other tools do no not really matter in aiding to understand code as quickly as possible. Master Git as as soon as possible and you will accelerate how fast you understand code and accelerate learning to code.
