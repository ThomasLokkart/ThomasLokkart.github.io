# The monster called bureaucracy 

Let me take you on a spectacular ride along the depths of bureaucracy. This story exemplifies my first real experience with bureaucracy and the way it works. It was a  horror. This is going to be a long post, as it involves a lot of frustration and this is one way for me to deal with it. 

"In the Netherlands, we had this enormous scandal called 'de toeslagenaffaire,' which translates to the subsidy scandal. In short, a lot of institutions and politics pointed fingers at each other after many, mainly low-income households, were disadvantaged by the system. In the end, it was not the fault of one individual; it was an accumulation of mistakes, mainly in the civil service. As a result, many people lost their households, some became depressed, and others found themselves in financial difficulty. It was (and still is) a horrible situation. It has been years since politics acknowledged their mistakes, and people are still waiting for compensation for everything they went through, largely due to the monster of bureaucracy."

Now, in no way I mean to intend that I know what these victims went through or what they are still going through. My experience is one that is more insubstantial. However, through my recent experience with bureaucracy, I feel that I slightly understand how difficult it can be. This is intended as a small introduction for those who do not. Yet..."

For educational purposes I will call the company 'Ted's apple picking machine company', so clear that it is fake, there is no way of understanding what I am referring to. 

## Where it all began

The month of June was just before I was set to move to a new apartment (who would ever need an apple picking machine in an apartment, so it's clear that this is fake and totally anonymous). I ordered a machine from Ted at the end of June, while I was moving into my new apartment on the first of July. It was reasonable to expect that the machine wouldn't arrive until after I moved, so I accepted that I wouldn't have the machine when I started. I ordered a specific new type of machine that would replace all the old machines within two years, so there was no reason to order the older one.

Ted quickly sent the required parts that I could assemble myself, great! The first week of July, I called Ted because unfortunately there was a part missing: the motor. This meant that I had received everything except, quite possibly, the most important part to make the machine actually work. The installation help that Ted kindly provided indicated that I had missed this part, which Ted didn't tell me about, but I had to find out on my own. Ted promised that the machine would be working three days from then. This is where the problems started.

## Outsourcing

Ted is a big company that sells apple picking machines to almost every household in the nation and has a monopoly on the supply chain for spare parts. However, Ted also understands that it is wise to outsource services that they don't want to do themselves to others. This is where everything starts to go wrong.

As you may have guessed, I was forwarded to a different company. So, naive as I was, I called them, and I even had a conversation with them and gave them an honest chance. This was the first layer of bureaucracy. It turns out that the company Ted referred me to also didn't do the actual work themselves, so I was forwarded again to a new company that would actually deliver the part I was looking for. I got in touch with their customer service.

If you think that's it, read on, because it turns out I had a special kind of machine that required one more company down the line to get in contact with. Specifically, this was the fourth company since I started calling. This company turned out to be the worst of the worst in terms of what they did. Because they only had one job, which they, you guessed it, don't do.

## Customer service 

Ted, being the kind company that it is, still has customer service. Or, in my opinion, a group of people who were unfortunate enough to not have a particularly desirable skillset. Because, in my brutally honest opinion, people who work in customer service seem to be expected only to do a few things:

-   Forward responsibilities to a different company.
-   Hang up the phone.
-   Politely say that they cannot help you.
-   Give some sugar to keep the customers at bay, but don't really help them at all.
-   Overhear your complaints and manage to do as little as possible about them.

I'm willing to discuss these, but in my unvarnished opinion, this is all they do.

## Efficiency 

And in the end, you just give up... You are tired of fighting opposing the stream. It feels as everyone is there to screw you over, and set you back further. Until you... Give up. And that, is exactly the point where no one wins. The institution failed to deliver your promise and you do not get what you deserve. Everyone loses. 

In the end I gave it one more shot. I called Ted again, who told me politely to not call the fourth company down the line since there were supply chain issues and just wait for my turn. I did not listen. I called them and eventually, finally got a hold of them. They showed up. The spare part was delivered in 1 day. And that was that. 

I see that this blog post has become more of a rant and not so much of a constructive argument. I don't care.
