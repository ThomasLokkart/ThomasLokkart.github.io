# Working as a software engineer

Developing software can be one of the most frustrating jobs out there. You're going to fail. And this is why I love it so much. 

I have been writing software for four months now for a customer. At times I have the idea that I can't do anything. That I have no talent. That I don't understand anything. However, every time I succeed in something, it gives me a huge boost. 

The frustrations are in the fact that I feel like I need help for everything. That I can't solve things well enough on my own or figure out the fundamental cause of something. I always get pretty far with figuring out where to approximately where I need to be, but then miss the experience to properly finish it.

Summarizing the past period, I have mainly learned that things will work against you. You're not going to fix all the stories right away. There are engineers who have been there for a long time, have more knowledge, who cannot do this within a day. That's part of it. 

The satisfaction however when it succeeds, that is what I do it for. There seems to be a huge release of dopamine every time you solve a problem. The purpose of this blog is also to write about (starting as a) software engineering. Starting, and relatively inexperienced, programmers may be able to learn something from the bumps I have experienced or recognize them.
